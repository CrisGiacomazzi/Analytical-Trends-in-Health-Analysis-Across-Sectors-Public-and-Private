# Analytical-Trends-in-Health-Analysis-Across-Sectors-Public-and-Private

* The objective here was to explore which types of analyses are most commonly used in different countries and sectors (public vs. private).
I conducted an exploratory analysis of open-ended survey responses from colleagues across multiple countries and sectors (public vs. private) in University of Toronto to identify patterns in the types of analyses most frequently performed in their organizations.

* Applied text cleaning, tokenization, word frequency analysis, and visualizations (bar charts, word clouds, and topic modeling in R) to uncover cross-sector and cross-country trends, providing insights into the analytical maturity and priorities of different contexts.

* This project was implemented in R using `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` for data processing and visualization, `tidytext` and `tm` for text mining, `wordcloud` for word frequency visualization, and `topicmodels` for topic extraction.

* Results indicate that descriptive analytics dominates across sectors, with the majority of respondents reporting its use as their primary form of analysis, highlighting a shared focus on summarizing and understanding existing data.
